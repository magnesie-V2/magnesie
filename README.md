# Magnesie V2

## Project presentation

This project's goal is to use micro-services to generate 3D-models of any object and make them available on a website. The idea is to only deploy and run the photogrammetry service to generate the models when the cluster on which it will be deployed has available green energy.

This project is based on the first version of magnesie : https://github.com/magnesie/magnesie
